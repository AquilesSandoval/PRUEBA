# AIYM Training Application

## Overview
AIYM is a comprehensive athlete training management system originally built with a PHP/Yii backend. This version has been migrated to run on Replit with a Node.js/Express backend and PostgreSQL database.

## Project Structure

### Backend
- **Server**: Node.js with Express (port 5000)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon)
- **Location**: `/server/index.js`

### Frontend
- **Type**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Framework**: jQuery, Bootstrap, Leaflet (maps)
- **Location**: Root directory with subdirectories for different modules

### Main Modules
1. **ATLETAS** - Athlete management
   - Dashboard, profiles, Garmin/Strava integration
   - Interviews and assessments (PARQ, cardiovascular, etc.)

2. **MACRO/MESO/MICRO** - Training cycle management
   - Macrocycles (6-12 months)
   - Mesocycles (3-6 weeks)
   - Microcycles (weekly)

3. **INFORMES** - Performance reports
   - Ergospirometric tests
   - Lactate analysis

4. **POSIBLES NO NECESARIOS** - Additional features
   - Exercises, circuits, drills, sessions

## Database Schema

The database includes the following main tables:
- `atletas` - Athletes information
- `macrociclos`, `mesociclos`, `microciclos` - Training cycles
- `sesiones` - Training sessions
- `ejercicios` - Exercise library
- `circuitos` - Circuit training
- `informes`, `informes_ergo`, `informes_lactato` - Performance reports
- `entrevistas` - Athlete interviews/questionnaires
- `drills` - Technical drills
- `zonas_entrenamiento` - Training zones

Full schema available in `schema.sql`

## API Structure

The backend provides REST API endpoints:

### Athletes
- GET `/api/athletes` - List all athletes
- GET `/api/athletes/:id` - Get athlete details
- POST `/api/athletes` - Create new athlete

### Sessions
- GET `/api/sessions` - List sessions
- POST `/api/sessions` - Create session

### Reports
- GET `/api/informes/ergo/:id` - Get ergospirometric report
- GET `/api/informes/lactato/:id` - Get lactate report

### Support Endpoints
- Various endpoints for dropdowns, lookups, etc.

## API Adapter

The `api-adapter.js` file provides compatibility between the old PHP routes and new Express API. It intercepts AJAX calls from the original frontend and redirects them to the new backend.

## Authentication

The application now includes a secure authentication system:

### Login Credentials (Development)
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: Admin

### Authentication Features
- JWT-based authentication with 24-hour token expiration
- Bcrypt password hashing for security
- Session persistence with "Remember Me" functionality
- Login page with custom background image
- Logout functionality redirects to login page

### Database Tables
- `users` - User authentication and profile information
  - Fields: id, username, password_hash, email, nombre, rol, activo

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/login` - Authenticate user and receive JWT token
  - Request: `{ username, password }`
  - Response: `{ success, token, user }`

### UI Simplification (October 10, 2025)
1. **Navbar cleanup (applied to ALL 39 HTML files):**
   - Removed language selector
   - Removed "Lecciones" option
   - Removed "Progresi√≥n", "Personal", "Sesi√≥n" from Training menu
   - Removed "Dashboard" and "Perfiles" from main menu
   - Removed "Patrocinios" from profile menu, kept only logout option
   - Created automated Node.js script (`update_navbars.js`) to apply changes consistently across entire project

### Athlete CRUD Implementation (October 10, 2025)
1. **Backend API Endpoints** (`/server/index.js`):
   - `GET /api/athletes` - List all active athletes
   - `GET /api/athletes/:id` - Get specific athlete details
   - `POST /api/athletes` - Create new athlete with all fields
   - `PUT /api/athletes/:id` - Update athlete information
   - `DELETE /api/athletes/:id` - Soft delete (marks as inactive)
   - All endpoints support: nombre, apellido, fecha_nacimiento, email, telefono, deporte_principal, genero, peso, altura, notas

2. **Athlete Add Form** (`ATLETAS/Atletas AGREGAR.html`):
   - Clean, simplified form with essential athlete fields
   - Input validation and required field indicators
   - Real-time API integration with success/error handling
   - Redirect to athlete list after successful creation
   - Icons: üíæ Save button, Cancel button with icon

3. **Athlete List with Cards** (`ATLETAS/Atletas INICIO.html`):
   - Replaced static table with dynamic card-based grid layout
   - Real-time athlete loading from API
   - Search functionality (by name, email, phone)
   - Filter by sport (Carrera, Bici, Nataci√≥n, Triatl√≥n, Otro)
   - Card displays: photo, name, age, email, phone, sport badge

## Running the Application

The application runs automatically via the configured workflow:
```bash
npm start
```

Server runs on: `http://0.0.0.0:5000`

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables (auto-configured by Replit):
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE` - Database credentials

## Development Notes

### Adding New API Endpoints
1. Add route handler in `/server/index.js`
2. Update `/api-adapter.js` if mapping from old PHP route
3. Restart the workflow

### Database Changes
The schema is managed via direct SQL. To modify:
1. Update schema in database
2. Document changes in `schema.sql`

### Frontend Modifications
Frontend files are served statically. Changes take effect immediately (browser refresh may be needed).

## Known Issues

- Some advanced features from original PHP backend may need additional API endpoints

## Architecture

This is a traditional server-rendered application with:
- Backend API for data operations
- Static frontend with jQuery for interactivity
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Leaflet for map visualizations
- Bootstrap for UI components

The application was designed for sports trainers to manage athletes, training cycles, sessions, and performance assessments.
